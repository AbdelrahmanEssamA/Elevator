# Elevator RTS Project
The elevator system controller designed in our project is considered an “ideal” elevator in which some of the technical corners are cut.
Our elevator has the basic functionalities and essentials that usual elevator systems have, such as moving up and down, open and close doors, and of course,
alarming of excess capacity, emergency brakes and basic car and call buttons.
